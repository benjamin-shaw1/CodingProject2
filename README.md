# Data Processings 
---------------------
The purpose of this project was to create a Python code that could 
leverage Generative AI to create a chatbot that can answer questions 
on information found in a loaded PDF. 

Using OpenAI APIs, Hugging Face Embeddings, pytesseract, LangChian, and unstructured libraries 
PDF files can be injected, vectorized, and then passed to Chrom DB for storage. Then using an OpenAI LLM API call 
and LangChain QA chains, question prompts can be given about the pdf contents and answers generated

As such this script is useful for researching, pulling information from PDFs, and quickly 
summarizing PDF files making it a useful tool to have available for everyday work and or personal 
use.
